BASIC_PKG_INFO

This package contains the documentation and the development files of libdrm
version PKG_UPSTREAM_VERSION.

libdrm does not prominently give a license under the terms of which it is to be
distributed. However a source file states that it is necessary to redistribute
the included licensing and copyright information. It looks like the MIT license.

I do not include it herein and may never do that, depending on how much time I
have. However the source package can (or at least could as the time of this
writing) be found at https://dri.freedesktop.org/libdrm/.
