BASIC_PKG_INFO

This package contains the development files and the documentation of
Wayland version PKG_UPSTREAM_VERSION. The utility wayland-scanner is also
included.
The static libwayland-egl is not included since Mesa's version shall be used.

Licensing information can be found in /usr/share/doc/PKG_NAME. It is probably
incomplete.
