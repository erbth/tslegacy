BASIC_PKG_INFO

This package contains the documentation of Perl version PKG_UPSTREAM_VERSION.

The author of Perl decided that it may be distributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License version 1 or any later version, or under the terms
of the Artistic license.

I choose to distribute it subject to the GPL version 2, however for completeness
I included the Artistic license, which is distributed with the source package,
and the original README file, which states this matter, in
/usr/share/doc/PKG_NAME.
A copy of the GPL version 2 can be found in /usr/share/doc/licenses.
