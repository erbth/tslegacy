BASIC_PKG_INFO

This package contains the Linux kernel version PKG_UPSTREAM_VERSION, configured
for TSCLient LEGACY.
The kernel documentation is available in the package linux-doc.

LICENSE_GPL20([Linux])

The kernel's configuration is based on a configuration from the Debian package
linux-image-4.9.0-6-amd64. Starting from there, I have made some adaptions and
followed the suggestions given in the book `Linux From Scratch', `Version 8.2'
by Gerard Beekmans and Managing Editor Bruce Dubbs. At the time I initially
wrote this file, the book was available from www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs.
