# I adapted these modifications from the book
# `Linux From Scratch', `Version 8.2' by Gerard Beekmans and Managing Editor
# Bruce Dubbs since the entire package ecosystem follows it closely. At the time
# I initially wrote this file, the book was available from
# www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs.

# "Disable the installation of the groups program and its man pages, as
# Coreutils provides a better version." (LFS 8.2, p. 134)
# Copied form there:
sed -i 's/groups$(EXEEXT) //' src/Makefile.in
find man -name Makefile.in -exec sed -i 's/groups\.1 / /' {} \;

# Also taken from LFS 8.2 (p.134)
sed -i  -e 's@#ENCRYPT_METHOD DES@ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512@' \
        -e 's@/var/spool/mail@/var/mail@' etc/login.defs

# Also taken from LFS 8.2 (p.134)
sed -i 's/1000/999/' etc/useradd
