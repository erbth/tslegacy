# The book `Linux From Scratch', `Version 8.2' by Gerard Beekmans and Managing
# Editor Bruce Dubbs suggests to not install resizecons since it required
# svgalib, which would, according to the authors, not work properly. At the time
# I initially wrote this file, the book was available from
# www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs.
