	\section{ABI versioning and essential packages}
	
	\section{Notes about specific packages}
	
	This is the moment when I realize that it's gonna be so much more than I had believed ever. That I'll dig much deeper into each package than I thought, and that I'll give it much more time than I had ever meant.
	
	\subsection{util-linux}
	
	I decided to build util-linux without support for udev for now. I do not want to work around this cyclic dependency yet. We will see what will come.
	
	\subsection{elfutils}
	
	I decided to build elfutils without support for lzma. The two compression packages, zlib and bzip2, may suffice. However I am not sure about this yet, it is just trying.
