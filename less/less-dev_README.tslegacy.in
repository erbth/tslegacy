BASIC_PKG_INFO

This package contains the documentation of GNU less version PKG_UPSTREAM_VERSION.
The runtime files are contained in the TSLegacy package less.

LICENSE_GPL30([GNU less])

The upstream sources may alternatively be redistributed under the terms of the
`less license file'. I decided to redistribute less under the terms of
the GPL. For completeness however the `less license file' and the README file
of less are included in /usr/share/doc/PKG_NAME.
